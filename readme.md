RestClient
==========

RestClient is a Windows Rest Client.

Intended Features:
------------------
* retain list of last 20 unique urls
* save and open constructed http calls including url, http method, and http headers
* be able to call standard rest services
* be able to work with salesforce rest api & fetch auth token in background if needed
* enable easy entry of common http headers
* display http request
* display http response
* be able to save http request / response 

Please note this is my first project using XAML & RestClient so things are going to look a little rough until I figure them out.
